# lyrics-search-app
A simple app for finding the lyrics to a song and storing old searches

I have no prior experience with Javascript, React, or React Native. This is a toy project to practice them and in particular to get experience working with React Navigation and Redux.

To run this, you need to create the file `lyrics/secret.js`. It should contain the following:
```
REACT_APP_GENIUS_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```
